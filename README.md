## Welcome to ACML19 Weakly-supervised Learning Workshop

# Topic Description

UC terminates subscriptions with world’s largest scientific publisher in push for open access to publicly funded research, since “Knowledge should not be accessible only to those who can pay,” said Robert May, chair of UC’s faculty Academic Senate. Similarly, machine learning should not be accessible only to those who can pay. Specifically, modern machine learning is migrating to the era of complex models (e.g., deep neural networks), which require a plethora of well-annotated data. Giant companies have enough money to collect well-annotated data. However, for startups or non-profit organizations, such data is barely acquirable due to the cost of labeling data or the intrinsic scarcity in the given domain.

These practical issues motivate us to research and pay attention to weakly-supervised learning (WSL), since WSL does not require such a huge amount of annotated data. We define WSL as the collection of machine learning problem settings and algorithms that share the same goals as supervised learning but can only access to \emph{less supervised information} than supervised learning.

In this workshop, we discuss both theoretical and applied aspects of WSL, which includes but not limited to the following topics:


# Topics of Interest

Interested topics include, but are not limited to:

- Novel deep learning methods for multi-output learning tasks.

- Novel modellings for multi-output learning from new perspectives.

- Statistical theory analysis for multiple output learning.

- Large-scale optimization algorithms for multiple output learning.

- Sparse representation learning for large-scale multiple output learning.

- Active learning for multi-output data.

- Online learning for multi-output data.

- Metric learning for multi-output data.

- Multi-output learning with noisy data.  

- Multi-output learning with imbalanced data. 

- New applications.


# Submission Guidelines

Workshop submissions and camera ready versions will be handled by Microsoft CMT. Click [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAIMOL2019](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAIMOL2019) for submission. 

Papers should be formatted according to the IJCAI formatting instructions for the Conference Track. The submissions with 2 pages will be considered for the poster, while the submissions with at least 4 pages will be considered for the oral presentation. 

IJCAI-MoL is a non-archival venue and there will be no published proceedings. The papers will be posted on the workshop website. It will be possible to submit to other conferences and journals both in parallel to and after IJCAI-MoL'19. Besides, we also welcome submissions to IJCAI-MoL that are under review at other conferences and workshops. 

At least one author from each accepted paper must register for the workshop. Please see the IJCAI 2019 Website for information about accommodation and registration.
