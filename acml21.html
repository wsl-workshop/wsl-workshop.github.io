<h1 id="topic-summary">Topic Summary</h1>

<p>Machine learning should not be accessible only to those who can pay. Specifically, modern machine learning is migrating to the era of complex models (e.g., deep neural networks), which require a plethora of well-annotated data. Giant companies have enough money to collect well-annotated data. However, for startups or non-profit organizations, such data is barely acquirable due to the cost of labeling data or the intrinsic scarcity in the given domain. These practical issues motivate us to research and pay attention to <strong>weakly-supervised learning (WSL)</strong>, since WSL does not require such a huge amount of annotated data. We define WSL as the collection of machine learning problem settings and algorithms that share the same goals as supervised learning but can only access to <strong>less supervised information</strong> than supervised learning. In this workshop, we discuss both theoretical and applied aspects of WSL.

  Meanwhile, we will invite qualified submissions to <strong>a special issue in Springer Nature Computer Science</strong>.</p>

<p>This workshop is a series of our previous workshops at
IJCAI'21, ACML'19 '20, and SDM'20. <strong>Welcome!</strong>

Our particular emphasis at this workshop is incomplete supervision, inexact supervision, inaccurate supervision, cross-domain supervision, imperfect demonstration, and <font color="#FF0000">weak adversarial supervision (new topic)</font> . </p>

  <li>Broad applications of weakly-supervised learning, such as weakly supervised <strong>object detection</strong>, weakly supervised <strong>sequence modeling</strong>, weakly supervised <strong>cross-media retrieval</strong>, and weakly supervised <strong>medical image segmentation</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="topic-description">Topic Description</h1>

<p>The focus of this workshop is six types of weak supervision: incomplete supervision, inexact supervision, inaccurate supervision, cross-domain supervision, imperfect demonstration, and weak adversarial supervision. 
Specifically, incomplete supervision considers a subset of training data given with ground-truth labels while the other data remain unlabeled, such as semi-supervised learning and positive-unlabeled learning. 

Inexact supervision considers the situation where some supervision information is given but not as exacted as desired, i.e., only coarse-grained labels are available. For example, if we are considering to classify every pixel of an image, rather than the image itself, then ImageNet becomes a benchmark with inexact supervision. Besides, multi-instance learning belongs to inexact supervision, where we do not exactly know which instance in the bag corresponds to the given ground-truth label. 

Inaccurate supervision considers the situation where the supervision information is not always the ground-truth, such as label-noise learning.</p>

<p>Cross-domain supervision considers the situation where the supervision information is scarce or even non-existent
in the current domain but can be possibly derived from other domains. Examples of cross-domain supervision appear in zero-/one-/few-shot learning, where external knowledge from other domains is usually used to overcome the problem of too few or even no supervision in the original domain. 

Imperfect demonstration considers the situation for inverse reinforcement learning and imitation learning, where the agent learns with imperfect or non-expert demonstrations. For example, AlphaGo learns a policy from a sequence of states and actions (expert demonstration). Even if an expert player wins a game, it is not guaranteed that every action in the sequence is optimal.</p>

<p>Weak adversarial supervision considers the situation where weak supervision meets adversarial robustness. 
Since ML models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, AI security attracts more and more attention from both academia and industry. Therefore, many robust learning algorithms aim to prevent various evasion attacks, e.g., adversarial attacks, privacy attacks, model stealing attacks, and so on. 
However, almost all those robust algorithms (against evasion attacks) implicitly assume the strong supervision signals, which hardly meets the requirements in practice. For example, almost all adversarial training algorithms assume the labels of training data are clean without any noisy labels, which is not true in practice even in the example of benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10 and MNIST. 
Therefore, when we develop evasion-robust algorithms, it is very practical/urgent to consider the supervision signals are imperfect. 
</p>

<p>This workshop will discuss the fundamental theory of weakly supervised learning. Although theories of weakly supervised statistical learning already exist, extending these results for weakly supervised learning is still a challenge. Besides, this workshop also discusses on broad applications of weakly supervised learning, such as weakly supervised object detection (computer vision), weakly supervised sequence modeling (natural language processing), weakly supervised cross-media retrieval (information retrieval), and weakly supervised medical image segmentation (healthcare analysis).</p>

<h1 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h1>

<p>Papers should be formatted according to the ACML2021 formatting instructions for the Conference Track. The submissions with 2 pages will be considered for the poster, while the submissions with at least 4 pages will be considered for the oral presentation. Workshop submissions and camera ready versions will be handled by CMT. 
Workshop submissions and camera ready versions will be handled by email. Please E-mail your paper to jingfeng.zhang@riken.jp (tentative) with subject line ACML21-WSRL-{paper name} </p>

<p>ACML21-WSRL is a non-archival venue and there will be no published proceedings. The papers will be posted on the workshop website. It will be possible to submit the ACML21-WSRL submissions to other conferences and journals both in parallel to and after
ACML21-WSRL, if they accept such submissions. Besides, we also welcome submissions to ACML2021-WSRL that are under review at other conferences and workshops, if they allow concurrent submissions. At least one author from each accepted paper must register for the workshop. Please see the ACML21-WSRL Website for information about registration.</p>
