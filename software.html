<h1 id="weaklysupervised"><hr>Weakly supervised learning</h1>
    <p>
        <i>Standard supervised learning</i> relies on fully supervised or fully labeled data, which means that every instance is associated with a label, in order to teach a model how to map an instance to its label.
        In practice, however, collecting such data is often <i>expensive</i> in terms of budget and/or time window for labeling or sampling big enough data, or even <i>impossible</i> since it may cause privacy and/or fairness issues.
        <i>Weakly supervised learning</i> is aimed at solving a learning task from only weakly supervised or weakly labeled data, e.g., the positive class is present while the negative class is absent.
        Our weakly supervised trained models still try to <i>capture the underlying map</i> from an instance to its label and to <i>predict the true label</i> of any instance exactly the same as fully supervised trained models.
    </p>  
    <h2>Positive-unlabeled learning</h2>
    <p>
      Positive-unlabeled learning is aimed as solving a binary classification problem only from positive and unlabeled data, without negative data.

<h1 id="labelnoise"><hr>Label-noise learning</h1>
    <p>
        Standard supervised learning relies on high-quality <i>clean labels</i>, which means that instances are with labels drawn from the <i>clean class-posterior probability</i>.
        Nevertheless, if we require every instance to be associated with a label, our collected labels would probably come from non-expert annotators or be automatically annotated based on logs in practice.
        Such lower-quality labels are called <i>noisy labels</i> and regarded as drawn from some <i>noisy/corrupted class-posterior probability</i>, resulting in a mixture of correctly and incorrectly labeled data.
        <i>Label-noise learning</i> is aimed at solving a learning task from such possibly mislabeled data, where our models trained with noisy labels still try to <i>predict the true label</i> of any instance exactly the same as models trained with clean labels.

<h1 id="adversarial"><hr>Adversarial robustness</h1>
    <p>
        When we deploy models trained by standard supervised learning, they work well on <i>natural</i> test data.
        However, those models cannot handle <i>adversarial</i> test data (also known as <i>adversarial examples</i>) that are algorithmically generated by <i>adversarial attacks</i>.
        An adversarial attack is an algorithm which applies specially designed <i>tiny perturbations</i> on natural data to transform them into adversarial data, in order to mislead a trained model and let it give wrong predictions.
        <i>Adversarial robustness</i> is aimed at improving the robust accuracy of trained models against adversarial attacks.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Algorithm perspective</h2>
    <p>
        From the algorithm perspective, we would like to design <i>smarter loss/objective functions</i> for training standard models.
        Specifically, given the knowledge that the test data may be adversarial, we carefully <i>simulate some adversarial attack during training</i>.
        Thus, the model has already seen many adversarial training data in the past, and hopefully it can generalize to adversarial test data in the future.

    <h2>Model perspective</h2>
    <p>
        From the model perspective, we would like to design <i>smarter models</i> that can be robust even when they are trained by standard supervised learning.
        Indeed, some models are <i>born to be more robust</i> than other models, because they possess special layers and components designed for removing or reducing the negative effects of adversarial attacks.

    <h2>Detection perspective</h2>
    <p>
        From the detection perspective, we would like to check whether a set of data has been attacked;
        if the given data have been attacked, we want to know further which one has been attacked and which one has not.
        For the data coming from the attacker but not the nature, we can <i>make more careful predictions</i> or even <i>abstain from giving predictions</i>.

    <h2>Application perspective</h2>
    <p>
    From the application perspective, we would like to apply the adversarial robustness to case studies.
    In particular, adversarial attacks are the ways of evaluating the vulnerabilities of machine learning models; adversarial training is the way of making the machine learning models robust against such vulnerabilities.
    Given a method empowered by machine learning approaches, we can leverage the adversarial attacks/training to evaluate/enhance the method's robustness.
